# TALES Resource Server

Integrates: [TALES](https://github.com/microsoft/tale-suite)

Specifically, this uses the train_test_split branch.

Partially based on code at [draft textworld implementation](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym/tree/cmunley1/textworld/resources_servers/textworld) and [workbench](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym/tree/main/resources_servers/workbench)

You need Java to run Scienceworld. If you don't have it, you'll get an error message but should otherwise be uneffected if you are using other environments.
